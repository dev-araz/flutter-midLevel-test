# responsive_list_with_api_data

This project is for testing and reviewing the status of an intermediate flutter programmer.

The application is presented in three pages, the first page uses Supabase for authentication, but due to a technical fault on the server side, the login and authentication page codes are currently suspended, and the software output currently works with two pages.
This application is also used to check the programmer's ability to work with the API, which provides a list of currency prices.
The third page provides details of each currency.
